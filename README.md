## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust traffic sign recognition model to improve the safety and efficiency of self-driving cars. Additionally, the project explores applications in wearable technology to assist people with visual impairments.

## Project Overview

Self-driving cars are transitioning from a futuristic concept to a reality. Accurate traffic sign recognition is crucial for their successful integration. This project aims to create a machine learning model that can accurately identify various traffic signs, contributing to safer roads and enhancing the utility of wearable technology for visually impaired individuals.

## Introduction & Motivation

The evolution of cars from automatic transmission to cruise control and autopilot features has set the stage for fully autonomous vehicles. Beyond self-driving cars, traffic sign recognition technology has immediate applications in wearable tech designed to assist visually impaired individuals. By developing accurate and reliable models, this project aims to contribute to safer roads and a more connected world.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is obtained from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). This dataset includes over 50,000 images of traffic signs belonging to 43 classes, providing a comprehensive foundation for training and evaluating traffic sign recognition models.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loading and exploring the dataset.
   - Data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training set.

   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed due to their high performance in image classification tasks.
   - Various architectures and hyperparameters are experimented with to identify the optimal configuration.

3. **Training**:
   - The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset using techniques such as batch normalization and dropout to improve generalization.

## Model Training

The model training process involves:
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Using data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting.
- Implementing early stopping and learning rate reduction strategies to optimize training.

## Results & Evaluation

The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Visualization techniques such as confusion matrices are used to identify misclassified instances and refine the model.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the feasibility of using CNNs for traffic sign recognition with high accuracy. The developed model contributes to the advancement of self-driving car technologies and wearable tech for visually impaired individuals.

## Challenges & Limitations
